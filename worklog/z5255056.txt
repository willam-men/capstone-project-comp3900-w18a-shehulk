Week 1
- Group formed. I created the Jira board as scrum master and submitted our group
name in webCMS.
- We discussed as a group which project to pursue, and the required features 
that we needed to implement to make an MVP of the project.
- After deciding on the Meal Recommendation System project, we brainstormed user 
stories needed for a Recipe website
- We also discussed the required project functionalities and the acceptance criteria

Week 2
- Front-end meeting to discuss what technologies to use (React, MaterialUI)
- Created a basic story board of how each front end page will look like, and 
what specific pages our website needed.
- Had a group meeting - with the backend team to figure out what data we needed
for each specific page
- Organised and delegated tickets on the Jira board with the group, specifically
what the front-end team was going to do
- I was tasked with creating the Explore Recipes page and the pagination functionality

Week 3
- Started working on frontend creating the explore page to display as many recipe cards
as we needed.
- Working on pagination for the explore page to make sure the explore page displays 
only 9 recipe cards on one page
- Started looking through the report and spoke about the front-end implementation
and the architectures that the front-end team used to build the website interface

Week 4
- Finished up the explore page, initially using mock data to display an array of recipe
cards. We intended to connect the frontend with the backend so that the explore page 
could be used with the data in our database
- Read over the report and worked as a group to find little details in the report
that could be improved before reaching group concensus and submitting as the Scrum Master

Week 5 
- I set up my own backend with Docker Desktop, however I ran into multiple issues with 
storage on my laptop, so Docker Desktop was running extremely slowly or crashing at times
- Cleaned up bugs with the Explore page and continued to work on pagination for the explore
page. My implementation of pagination was working with my local mock data in a .json file,
but many errors were occuring when trying to use pagination with the Docker data.
- Demoed the project for the first time at Project Demo A. We were able to demo the explore
page without pagination but with the docker data and I demoed my local explore page that 
had pagination working.

Week 6
- Continued working on pagination
- I significantly slowed down on my work, due to some highly distressing external and
family matters. A loved one had passed away and I was extremely overwhelmed handling the
logistics and paperwork.
- I intended on also creating and modifying the individual recipe cards that would be displayed
on all of our websites pages. I had implemented liking and hovering (to reveal more recipe details)
but was unable to finish due to external circumstances.

Week 7
- I continued trying to work on pagination, and finally had gotten it working for my explore 
page. however I had forgotten to let my team know this as I was significantly overwhelmed and 
distressed with external factors
- I continued to attempt to integrate pagination into the rest of the web pages

Week 8
- The team began working on multiple front-end bugs and I assisted with this.
- The team also acknowledged my severe lack of input into the project thus far, and I communicated
to them my external circumstances and acknowledged the lack of work that I had put in thus far
- It was agreed upon that I would be attempting my best to contribute to the remainder of the project
with whatever front-end functionalities needed to be completed, as well as the report and project
presentation
- Started working on small front-end bugs like breadcrumb navigation, front-end to back-end requests,etc

Week 9
- I began implementing updating a user's password and created a form in the Personal Settings page that 
pops up with a button.
- I also fixed the breadcrumming from All Users -> Personal Settings
- I added my own breadcrumbs that takes the user back to their own profile after changing their password
- Began working on the Final Project Report, talking about the project funtionalities that were implemented
as well as the system architecture, specifically the front-end frameworks and technologies that we used.
- I had also run into a lot of trouble integrating pagination for every other page such as All Users and 
Personal Feed. The usePagination hook that I had implemented was not displaying the correct recipe cards
at times, and sometimes not displaying anything at all.
- It had become too difficult and time consuming trying to implement pagination as I had in explore, so I
decided to not implement pagination for these pages, and thus remove pagination from the explore page so that 
it looks more neater and concise. The team also agreed on this.

Week 10
- Working on the Final Project Presentation and Report
- Wrote back-end tests to test users, recipe creation and deletion, and more.
